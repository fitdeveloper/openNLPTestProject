<START:payment> Visa ok <END> and <START:payment> MasterCard <END> are <START:payment> credit card <END> networks, or schemes or brands. They act as intermediaries between issuers and acquirers 
(typically banks) in authorizing <START:payment>credit card transactions<END>. They don't issue credit cards themselves, but do it in conjunction 
with issuers. E.g.
Your local bank would provide you with a <START:payment> credit <END> branded with Visa or MasterCard. If you try to make a purchase, any local 
shop which accepts Visa or MasterCard would be able to take a payment from you using your <START:payment> credit card <END>
An online merchant would likely be using a <START:payment> payment gateway <END> or a payment processor to interact with Visa/MasterCard's networks 
in order to facilitate that payment. This is where <START:payment> PayPal <END> comes in..
PayPal is a lot of things. It typically acts as processor or a gateway connecting to <START:payment1> Visa <END> etc. to facilitate 
payments. It is also a wallet, acting as an open-loop system which holds people's money akin to bank accounts. 
It is essentially a layer between users and a multitude of other financial services. E.g.
An online shop uses PayPal's gateway. So if you don't have a paypal account but only a credit / debit card, PayPal
 taps into <START:payment> Visa ok <END>  network and processes the transaction, ensuring that the transaction occurs between
 the respective issuers and acquirers in relation to your <START:payment> credit card <END>
An online shop uses PayPal's gateway. So if you have a PayPal account with some balance in it, you pay using that 
balance directly to the shop owner. The money thus moves from your PayPal account to the shop owner's PayPal account. 
Later on, when the shop owner wants to receive physical cash, she/he transfers money from her/his PayPal account 
to her/his bank account (a process typically known as settlement)
This is gross oversimplification and PayPal is getting progressively harder to classify. For most of its clients, 
PayPal is an aggregator/master merchant. For larger merchants, when it assigns an individual merchant account, 
it is an ISO. In the U.S., they clear transactions through four acquirers: WorldPay, Global Payments/HSBC, First Data, 
and Chase PaymentTech. In Europe, they clear transactions through WorldPay and Global Payments/HSBC. (via Ben Brown -

PayPal (in Europe at least) is a registered bank, and they provide audited, electronic fund transfer between your account
 (on PayPal) and someone else's. They use their own method to do this, which has the advantage of not requiring 
 your details to be sent to a human being. There is therefore no risk of having your card number stolen, because 
 you don't have one. Generally speaking, your PayPal account can be linked to your real bank account 
 (usually by card, but not always), and money taken from your account when your PayPal balance reaches zero. 
 (This can cause confusion, as if you ever receive a one-off payment to your PayPal account, your bank balance won't 
 reflect your next PayPal payments until the balance gets used up).
With <START:payment> Visa ok <END>
you will be given your card details to the other person, and taking it on trust that they won't take more money 
than they claim, and won't ever use their card details a second time. This sounds bad, but you do get two forms of
 protection: one is that failing to properly secure someone's card details is an offence in most countries, 
 and the other party could go to jail for abusing your trust, and most intelligent people won't risk that. 
 The other is that your bank has an anti-fraud department that will actively monitor all their customer's accounts for suspicious activity.

Generally speaking, payment with PayPal is secure, but you're not protected from the other person running away with your money or providing you
 with shoddy goods (except for some eBay purchases, which are insured automatically). Payment by card is not secure, particularly when dealing with people you don't know.
 Either way, the most common problems are goods not being sent or being as described; payment problems are rare but can be devastating.
